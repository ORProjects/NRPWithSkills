Abstract
====================
<p align="justify">The Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP) is a complex scheduling problem where nurses must be assigned to shifts considering a set of constraints. The NRP is difficult to solve to optimality due to its combinatorial structure. This paper presents a hybrid solution algorithm that combines Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based heuristics namely Fix-and-Relax (F&R) and Fix-and-Optimize (F&O) and Simulated Annealing (SA) to deal with the NRP. The main idea behind the MIP based heuristics is that the problem is decomposed into a set of smaller problems and the set is iteratively solved to optimality. In the hybrid approach, high quality initial solutions are obtained via the F&R step and fed to the SA part of the algorithm. Additionally, the F&O algorithm is inserted into the SA step when solutions can no longer be improved. This enables the hybrid algorithm to diversity the search space and to provide better solutions. To assess the quality and efficiency of the hybrid approach, we use 24 publicly available test instances recently introduced in the literature. Computational results show that the hybrid method outperforms state-of-the-art solution techniques in most of the test data.</p>

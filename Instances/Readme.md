`INSTANCES`
====================

XML files are for computational experiments of the study. They are generated taking the following data sets as a starting point: http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/nrp/. Because of the fact that original model and data have been improved by incorporating skill related constraints, new example files are different not only including existing constraints, but also having skill related ones.


- [Instance 01](/Instances/Instance_01.xml)
- [Instance 02](/Instances/Instance_02.xml)
- [Instance s](/Instances/Instance_s.xml)
